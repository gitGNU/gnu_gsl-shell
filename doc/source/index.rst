Welcome to GSL shell documentation
##################################

GSL shell is an interactive command line interface that gives easy access
to the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) collection of mathematical methods for
numerical computations.

GSL shell can be used interactively to perform calculations with matrices or
vectors but it does allow also to write complex user defined functions with
the Lua scripting interpreter.

Lua is a very interesting and easy to learn scripting language that features
advanced functionalities like closures and metamethods. Lua is very
easy to learn and will give you the power of defining your own complex routines
to use the GSL library more effectively.

GSL Shell is hosted at `Savannah <http://savannah.nongnu.org>`_, here is the `project page <https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/gsl-shell/>`_.

You can download the latest release of GSL Shell in the `download page <https://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=gsl-shell>`_. You will find the source code, a binary package that require GSL 1.14 (or more recent) and readline5.

GSL shell is free software, everyone can freely use it, adapt or study the source code. You can contribute to its development by making a donation:

You can subscribe the `mailing list <http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gsl-shell-info>`_ to discuss about GSL Shell. The author of the software is Francesco Abbate, you can contact him at the followng address:
